3. Choose By Set or By Card Name
4a. By Set:
4aa: Select the Set
4ab: Select the Card Name
4ac: Image of the card should be showing below! 
4b: By Card Name
4ba: Type in a card name (for this test you can use Scyther if you don't know any card names)

Change Log:
- Introduction of the Loading Screen to allow the loading of all cards on start up
- Loading all cards / sets from the API on load to reduce the amount of API calls made through the usage of the app
- Making the search term in By Card Name more reliable (ex: ho oh will pull ho-oh, and other small things)
- Making the By Card Name search sort the cards via set release (this was only obtainable once loading all cards into the app on load)
- Small padding fixes
